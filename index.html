				<h2>Bouncing Ball</h2>

				Ball bouncing in 3D in openGL, constrained in the x, y, z directions at a maximum ceiling and floor. If the ball would have passed that direction maximum, it's position and velocity are set to simulate boucing. Eulerian integration is used to solve for the position and velocity.
				On each bounce, the ball's rotation is set based on the velocity not in the impact direction.

				Fire simulation very similar to fountain simulation only with altered gravity and initial velocity, and changes color as the particle ages. Particles also fade out as they age.

				3D cloth simulation using mass-spring system to determine the force applied at each point in the cloth compared to its immediate neighbors, and that force is used in determining the subsequent position using Euler's equations of motion over time. The sphere moves along the Z-axis, and when intersecting the points of the cloth pushes those points out of the way in a spherical manner.<br>
				Use WASD to move forward, back, and side to side, drag mouse to rotate view, and move mouse left or right to slide the sphere on its track.

				Tried the Shallow 1D integrated water simulation from the slides, kept getting NaN errors. Can't figure out where from, I've tried testing for negatives in the sqrts and deviding by 0 errors and checking for boundary conditions, nothing is fixing the problem.<br>

				<h2>Djikstra's algorithm with Obstacle</h2>
				<iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pq0inPEQaUw"></iframe><br>
				<a href="https://github.com/Clarvel/CSCI5611/tree/gh-pages/dijkstra_obj">Source</a><br>
				Using Dijkstra's algorithm and a Probabilistic Road Map to navigate a 3D space. The large green sphere is the goal, the large red sphere is the ai, the large black sphere is an obstacle, and the small green spheres are the points found by the probabilistic road map. Use WASD to move the camera in mode 0, the ai in mode 1, and the goal in mode 2. Drag the mouse to rotate camera. Set modes by pressing the corresponding number. Press enter or return to have the ai search. I accidentally made the obstacle too large, but this does not impact the algorithm much.<br>
				<p>(60) An animation of a point-like (zero size), game character is in a large 20m x 20m room. The character starts at the bottom left (-9,-9) and wishes to go to the top right (9,9). There is a single obstacle in the room, represented by a circle of radius 2 meters at coordinates (0,0). Use a probabilistic roadmap (PRM) to plan a path for the agent from the start to the goal.<br>
				(5) Circular agent (with extent) (consider replacing with 10 points for spherical objects in 3D space)<br>

				(5) 3D rendering of scenario and characters<br>
				(5) Allow the user to select start and goal at run time (Your position is a moving goal)</p>

				<h2>A* with multiple Obstacles</h2>

				<a href="https://github.com/Clarvel/CSCI5611/tree/gh-pages/dijkstra_astar_comp">Source</a><br>
				Using Dijkstra's algorithm and Astar with a Probabilistic Road Map to navigate a 3D space. The large green sphere is the goal, the large red sphere is the ai, the large black sphere are obstacles, and the small blue spheres are the points found by the probabilistic road map. Use WASD to move the camera in mode 0, the ai in mode 1, and the goal in mode 2. Drag the mouse to rotate camera. Set modes by pressing the corresponding number. Press enter or return to have the ai search. Press r to reset the ai's position. Press spacebar to swap between using dijkstra's algorithm and astar. In the video, both algorithms find the same path, but Astar ound it in 23 miliseconds, while dijkstra's algorithm found it in 88 milliseconds.<br>

				You are the goal. Try to stay ahead of the AI. The large red sphere is the ai, the large black spheres are obstacles, and the small blue spheres are the points found by the probabilistic road map. Use WASD to move the camera. Drag the mouse to rotate camera.<br>
				<p>(5) Make a game-like scenario involving the planning tool; best game gets 10 points.<br>
