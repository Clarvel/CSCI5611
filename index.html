			<h2>Bouncing Ball</h2>

			Ball bouncing in 3D in openGL, constrained in the x, y, z directions at a maximum ceiling and floor. If the ball would have passed that direction maximum, it's position and velocity are set to simulate boucing. Kinematics are used to solve for the position and velocity.
			On each bounce, the ball's rotation is set based on the velocity not in the impact direction.

			Water fountain in 3D, with a user controlled camera. Move left/right/forward/back with a/d/w/s respecively. Click and drag the mouse move the viewing center. Uses a textured and colored sprite image at each point.

			<h2>Fire</h2>

			Fire simulation very similar to fountain simulation only with altered gravity and initial velocity, and changes color as the particle ages. Particles also fade out as they age.

			Fireworks simulation as a combination of a moving particle emitter and a radial particle emitter with color changing particles. Audio effects are keyed to play when the firework starts and when it changes from the moving smoke emitter to stationary radial emitter.
