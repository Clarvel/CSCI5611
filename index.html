				<h2>Bouncing Ball</h2>

				Ball bouncing in 3D in openGL, constrained in the x, y, z directions at a maximum ceiling and floor. If the ball would have passed that direction maximum, it's position and velocity are set to simulate boucing. Eulerian integration is used to solve for the position and velocity.
				On each bounce, the ball's rotation is set based on the velocity not in the impact direction.

				Fire simulation very similar to fountain simulation only with altered gravity and initial velocity, and changes color as the particle ages. Particles also fade out as they age.

				Fireworks simulation as a combination of a moving particle emitter and a radial particle emitter with color changing particles. Audio effects are keyed to play when the firework starts and when it changes from the moving smoke emitter to stationary radial emitter.

				<h2>3D cloth simulation</h2>

				3D cloth simulation using mass-spring system to determine the force applied at each point in the cloth compared to its immediate neighbors, and that force is used in determining the subsequent position using Euler's equations of motion over time. The sphere moves along the Z-axis, and when intersecting the points of the cloth pushes those points out of the way in a spherical manner.<br>
				Use WASD to move forward, back, and side to side, drag mouse to rotate view, and move mouse left or right to slide the sphere on its track.

				<h2>1D water simulation.</h2>

				Tried the Shallow 1D integrated water simulation from the slides, kept getting NaN errors. Can't figure out where from, I've tried testing for negatives in the sqrts and deviding by 0 errors and checking for boundary conditions, nothing is fixing the problem.<br>
